	title={Normalizing Flow-based Differentiable Particle Filters},
	author={Chen, Xiongjie and Li, Yunpeng},
  abstract={Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalizing flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters’ performance through a series of numerical experiments.},

  title={Bayesian Detector Combination for Object Detection with Crowdsourced Annotations},
  author={Zhi Qin Tan and Olga Isupova and Gustavo Carneiro and Xiatian Zhu and Yunpeng Li},
  abstract={Acquiring fine-grained object detection annotations in unconstrained images is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to noise, especially in crowdsourcing scenarios. Most prior object detection methods assume accurate annotations; A few recent works have studied object detection with noisy crowdsourced annotations, with evaluation on distinct synthetic crowdsourced datasets of varying setups under artificial assumptions. To address these algorithmic limitations and evaluation inconsistency, we first propose a novel Bayesian Detector Combination (BDC) framework to more effectively train object detectors with noisy crowdsourced annotations, with the unique ability of automatically inferring the annotators’ label qualities. Unlike previous approaches, BDC is model-agnostic, requires no prior knowledge of the annotators’ skill level, and seamlessly integrates with existing object detection models. Due to the scarcity of real-world crowdsourced datasets, we introduce large synthetic datasets by simulating varying crowdsourcing scenarios. This allows consistent evaluation of different models at scale. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic crowdsourced datasets show that BDC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its superiority in leveraging crowdsourced data for object detection. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/zhiqin1998/bdc.},

  title={Augmented sliced Wasserstein distances},
  author={Chen, Xiongjie and Yang, Yongxin and Li, Yunpeng},
  abstract={While theoretically appealing, the application of the Wasserstein distance to large-scale machine learning problems has been hampered by its prohibitive computational cost. The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large, because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and real-world problems.},

  title={Imitation learning with Sinkhorn distances},
  author={Papagiannis, George and Li, Yunpeng},
  abstract={Imitation learning algorithms have been interpreted as variants of divergence minimization problems. The ability to compare occupancy measures between experts and learners is crucial in their effectiveness in learning from demonstrations. In this paper, we present tractable solutions by formulating imitation learning as minimization of the Sinkhorn distance between occupancy measures. The formulation combines the valuable properties of optimal transport metrics in comparing non-overlapping distributions with a cosine distance cost defined in an adversarially learned feature space. This leads to a highly discriminative critic network and optimal transport plan that subsequently guide imitation learning. We evaluate the proposed approach using both the reward metric and the Sinkhorn distance metric on a number of MuJoCo experiments.

  abstract={This paper presents the first large-scale multi-species dataset of acoustic recordings of mosquitoes tracked continuously in free flight. We present 20 hours of audio recordings that we have expertly labelled and tagged precisely in time. Significantly, 18 hours of recordings contain annotations from 36 different species. Mosquitoes are well-known carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever. Collecting this dataset is motivated by the need to assist applications which utilise mosquito acoustics to conduct surveys to help predict outbreaks and inform intervention policy. The task of detecting mosquitoes from the sound of their wingbeats is challenging due to the difficulty in collecting recordings from realistic scenarios. To address this, as part of the HumBug project, we conducted global experiments to record mosquitoes ranging from those bred in culture cages to mosquitoes captured in the wild. Consequently, the audio recordings vary in signal-to-noise ratio and contain a broad range of indoor and outdoor background environments from Tanzania, Thailand, Kenya, the USA and the UK. In this paper we describe in detail how we collected, labelled and curated the data. The data is provided from a PostgreSQL database, which contains important metadata such as the capture method, age, feeding status and gender of the mosquitoes. Additionally, we provide code to extract features and train Bayesian convolutional neural networks for two key tasks: the identification of mosquitoes from their corresponding background environments, and the classification of detected mosquitoes into species. Our extensive dataset is both challenging to machine learning researchers focusing on acoustic identification, and critical to entomologists, geo-spatial modellers and other domain experts to understand mosquito behaviour, model their distribution, and manage the threat they pose to humans.},

	title={Invertible particle-flow-based sequential MCMC with extension to Gaussian mixture noise models},
	author={Li, Yunpeng and Pal, Soumyasundar and Coates, Mark J.},
  abstract={Sequential state estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian state spaces has a wide range of applications in statistics and signal processing. One of the most effective non-linear filtering approaches, particle filtering, suffers from weight degeneracy in high-dimensional filtering scenarios. Several avenues have been pursued to address high dimensionality. Among these, particle flow filters construct effective proposal distributions by using invertible flow to migrate particles continuously from the prior distribution to the posterior, and sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods use a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) accept-reject approach to improve filtering performance. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of invertible particle flow and SMCMC by constructing a composite MH kernel within the SMCMC framework using invertible particle flow. In addition, we propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based particle flow algorithm to construct effective MH kernels for multi-modal distributions. Simulation results show that for high-dimensional state estimation example problems, the proposed kernels significantly increase the acceptance rate with minimal additional computational overhead and improve estimation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art filtering algorithms.},

	author={Li, Yunpeng and Porter, Emily and Santorelli, Adam and Popovi\'c, Milica and Coates, Mark},
  abstract={Microwave breast screening has been proposed as a complementary modality to the current standard of X-ray mammography. In this work, we design three ensemble classification structures that fuse information from multiple sensors to detect abnormalities in the breast. A principled Neyman–Pearson approach is developed to allow control of the trade-off between false positive rate and the false negative rate. We evaluate performance using data derived from measurements of heterogeneous breast phantoms. We also use data collected in a clinical trial that monitored 12 healthy patients monthly over an eight-month period. In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithms we model scans of breasts with malignant lesions by artificially adding simulated tumour responses to existing scans of healthy volunteers. Tumour responses are constructed based on measured properties of breast tissues and real breast measurements, thus the simulation model takes into account the heterogeneity of the breast tissue. The algorithms we present take advantage of breast scans from other patients or tissue-mimicking breast phantoms to learn about breast content and what constitutes a “tumour-free” and “tumour-bearing” set of measurements. We demonstrate that the ensemble selection-based algorithm, which constructs an ensemble of the most informative classifiers, significantly outperforms other detection techniques for the clinical trial data set.},

	title={Particle filtering with invertible particle flow},
	author={Li, Yunpeng and Coates, Mark},
  abstract={A key challenge when designing particle filters in high-dimensional state spaces is the construction of a proposal distribution that is close to the posterior distribution. Recent advances in particle flow filters provide a promising avenue to avoid weight degeneracy; particles drawn from the prior distribution are migrated in the state space to the posterior distribution by solving partial differential equations. Numerous particle flow filters have been proposed based on different assumptions concerning the flow dynamics. Approximations are needed in the implementation of all of these filters; as a result, the particles do not exactly match a sample drawn from the desired posterior distribution. Past efforts to correct the discrepancies involve expensive calculations of importance weights. In this paper, we present new filters which incorporate deterministic particle flows into an encompassing particle filter framework. The valuable theoretical guarantees concerning particle filter performance still apply, but we can exploit the attractive performance of the particle flow methods. The filters we describe involve a computationally efficient weight update step, arising because the embedded particle flows we design possess an invertible mapping property. We evaluate the proposed particle flow particle filters' performance through numerical simulations of a challenging multitarget multisensor tracking scenario and complex high-dimensional filtering examples.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
