Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top 3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out test data.

However, this process requires extensive expertise and is exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach.

To facilitate the learning of high dimensional parameter sets, such as those associated to neural networks, we adopt the emerging framework of differentiable particle filtering, wherein parameters are trained by gradient descent. We design a new differentiable interacting multiple model particle filter to be capable of learning the individual behavioural regimes and the model which controls the jumping simultaneously. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm allows control of the computational effort assigned per regime whilst using the probability of being in a given regime to guide sampling. Furthermore, we develop a new gradient estimator that has a lower variance than established approaches and remains fast to compute, for which we prove consistency.

While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships between objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge this gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as foundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as images and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant availability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to the scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response, recent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks, overcoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally, language, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the environment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and adoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in comprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods that utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various strategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and summarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks. Finally, the article offers insights into future directions for research and development in this field.

A suite of systems are being used to monitor and manage malaria risk and disease incidence, with an increasing focus on technological interventions that allow private citizens to remotely record and upload data. However, data collected by citizen scientists must be standardised and consistent if it is to be used for scientific analysis. Studies that aim to improve data collection quality and quantity have often included incentivisation, providing citizen scientists with monetary or other benefits for their participation in data collection. We tested whether monetary incentives enhance participation and data collection in a study trialling an acoustic mosquito sensor. Working with the community in two health areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we measured data collection participation, completeness, and community responses. Our results showed mixed responses to the incentive, with more participants interested in the social status and monetary value of the technology used than the monetary incentive itself. The effect of incentives on data collection varied over the course of the trial, increasing participation in the start of the trial but with no effect in the latter half of the trial. Feedback from participants showed that opinions on technology, research objectives, and incentives varied between communities, and was associated with differences in data collection quantity and quality, suggesting that differences in community interest in data collection and the incentives may be more important than the incentive value itself. These results suggest that though there is an initial benefit, extrinsic motivations do not override differences in intrinsic motivations over time, and enhanced communication and dialogue with participants may improve citizen science participation and attitudes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">DM</abbr> </div> <div id="Romero2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting restoration failures in primary and permanent teeth – A machine learning approach</div> <div class="author"> Vitor Henrique Digmayer Romero, Eduardo Trota Chaves, Shankeeth Vinayahalingam, Helena Silveira Schuch, Xiongjie Chen, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 9 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '9 more authors' ?

This condition has significant negative impacts on human health and imposes a substantial economic burden. In recent years, scientists and dentists have increasingly started to utilize artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, to improve the efficiency of dental caries management. This study aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the AI-enabled approaches for dental caries management within the framework of personalized patient care. Generally, AI works as a promising tool that can be used by both dental professionals and patients. For dental professionals, it predicts the risk of dental caries by analyzing dental caries risk and protective factors, enabling to formulate personalized preventive measures. AI, especially those based on machine learning and deep learning, can also analyze images to detect signs of dental caries, assist in developing treatment plans, and help to make a risk assessment for pulp exposure during treatment. AI-powered tools can also be used to train dental students through simulations and virtual case studies, allowing them to practice and refine their clinical skills in a risk-free environment. Additionally, AI tracks brushing patterns and provides feedback to improve oral hygiene practices of the patients and the general population, thereby improving their understanding and compliance. This capability of AI can inform future research and the development of new strategies for dental caries management and control.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">TSP</abbr> </div> <div id="Chen2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Normalizing Flow-based Differentiable Particle Filters</div> <div class="author"> Xiongjie Chen, and <em>Yunpeng Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (TSP)</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812895" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01499" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/xiongjiechen/Normalizing-Flows-DPFs" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/KCL_stats_seminar_2024_slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalizing flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters’ performance through a series of numerical experiments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ECCV</abbr> </div> <div id="Tan2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bayesian Detector Combination for Object Detection with Crowdsourced Annotations</div> <div class="author"> Zhi Qin Tan, Olga Isupova, Gustavo Carneiro, Xiatian Zhu, and <em>Yunpeng Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73036-8_19" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07958" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/zhiqin1998/bdc" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> <a href="https://eccv2024.ecva.net/virtual/2024/poster/420" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Acquiring fine-grained object detection annotations in unconstrained images is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to noise, especially in crowdsourcing scenarios. Most prior object detection methods assume accurate annotations; A few recent works have studied object detection with noisy crowdsourced annotations, with evaluation on distinct synthetic crowdsourced datasets of varying setups under artificial assumptions. To address these algorithmic limitations and evaluation inconsistency, we first propose a novel Bayesian Detector Combination (BDC) framework to more effectively train object detectors with noisy crowdsourced annotations, with the unique ability of automatically inferring the annotators’ label qualities. Unlike previous approaches, BDC is model-agnostic, requires no prior knowledge of the annotators’ skill level, and seamlessly integrates with existing object detection models. Due to the scarcity of real-world crowdsourced datasets, we introduce large synthetic datasets by simulating varying crowdsourcing scenarios. This allows consistent evaluation of different models at scale. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic crowdsourced datasets show that BDC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its superiority in leveraging crowdsourced data for object detection.

Occlusal contact detection is a vital tool for restoring the loss of masticatory function and is a mandatory assessment in the field of dentistry, with particular importance in prosthodontics and restorative dentistry. The most common method for occlusal contact detection is articulating paper. However, this method can indicate significant medically false positive and medically false negative contact areas, leaving the identification of true occlusal indications to clinicians. To address this, we propose a multiclass Vision Transformer and Fully Convolutional Network ensemble semantic segmentation model with a combination hierarchical loss function, which we name as Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Branch Transformer (H-FCBFormer). We also propose a method of generating medically true positive semantic segmentation masks derived from expert annotated articulating paper masks and gold standard masks. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning methods evaluated at detecting medically true positive contacts and performs better than dentists in terms of accurately identifying object-wise occlusal contact areas while taking significantly less time to identify them.

While the effectiveness of particle filters has been recognised in various applications, their performance relies on the knowledge of dynamic models and measurement models, as well as the construction of effective proposal distributions. An emerging trend involves constructing components of particle filters using neural networks and optimising them by gradient descent, and such data-adaptive particle filtering approaches are often called differentiable particle filters. Due to the expressiveness of neural networks, differentiable particle filters are a promising computational tool for performing inference on sequential data in complex, high-dimensional tasks, such as vision-based robot localisation. In this paper, we review recent advances in differentiable particle filters and their applications. We place special emphasis on different design choices for key components of differentiable particle filters, including dynamic models, measurement models, proposal distributions, optimisation objectives, and differentiable resampling techniques.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Asilomar</abbr> </div> <div id="li2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning Differentiable Particle Filter on the Fly</div> <div class="author"> Jiaxi Li, Xiongjie Chen, and <em>Yunpeng Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10476913" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05955" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Differentiable particle filters are an emerging class of sequential Bayesian inference techniques that use neural networks to construct components in state space models.

This leads to the delay of the model deployment and the obtained filters are susceptible to distribution shift of test-time data. In this paper, we propose an online learning framework for differentiable particle filters so that model parameters can be updated as data arrive. The technical constraint is that there is no known ground truth state information in the online inference setting. We address this by adopting an unsupervised loss to construct the online model updating procedure, which involves a sequence of filtering operations for online maximum likelihood-based parameter estimation.

For example, how can I decide whether I can trust my personal computer (A) or another computer (B), who communicates with A? In reality, both A and B are part of a computing network, in which there are many other computers, and these computers’ behaviour affects the trustworthiness of any communication between A and B. Obviously, the target of trusted computing is not only to build trusted devices but also trusted networks. Attestation is a mechanism initially designed to ascertain the trustworthiness of a single device. To check on the trustworthiness of a network, we need a network attestation mechanism. The basis of attestation is a root of trust, and research on building roots of trust for individual devices has been successful. One of the next challenges, the most important one, is to create a root of trust for network attestation. In this paper, we introduce our research on designing such a root of trust. This uses devices’ individual roots of trust and a decentralised ledger together with the techniques of “zero trust but verify”, which means that to start with, any entity in the system is not trusted until its functionality can be verified. Based on the verification results, the entities can establish trust. We aim to use such a root of trust to aggregate the attestation evidence and verification results from multiple devices in a network and to achieve trust in the network.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICASSP</abbr> </div> <div id="comandur2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Particle flow Gaussian sum particle filter</div> <div class="author"> Karthik Comandur, <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, and Santosh Nannuru </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10095327" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05104" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The particle flow Gaussian particle filter (PFGPF) uses an invertible particle flow to generate a proposal density.

The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large, because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and real-world problems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ECML</abbr> </div> <div id="Papagiannis2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Imitation learning with Sinkhorn distances</div> <div class="author"> George Papagiannis, and <em>Yunpeng Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-26412-2_8" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09167" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/gpapagiannis/sinkhorn-imitation" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/SIL_ECML_2022_slides" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Imitation learning algorithms have been interpreted as variants of divergence minimization problems.

Existing single-domain unsupervised representation learning methods perform poorly in this application, due to the unique cross-domain (sketch and photo) nature of the problem. We therefore introduce a novel framework that simultaneously performs sketch-photo domain alignment and semantic-aware representation learning. Technically this is underpinned by introducing joint distribution optimal transport (JDOT) to align data from different domains, which we extend with trainable cluster prototypes and feature memory banks to further improve scalability and efficacy.

Mosquitoes are well-known carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever. Collecting this dataset is motivated by the need to assist applications which utilise mosquito acoustics to conduct surveys to help predict outbreaks and inform intervention policy. The task of detecting mosquitoes from the sound of their wingbeats is challenging due to the difficulty in collecting recordings from realistic scenarios. To address this, as part of the HumBug project, we conducted global experiments to record mosquitoes ranging from those bred in culture cages to mosquitoes captured in the wild. Consequently, the audio recordings vary in signal-to-noise ratio and contain a broad range of indoor and outdoor background environments from Tanzania, Thailand, Kenya, the USA and the UK. In this paper we describe in detail how we collected, labelled and curated the data. The data is provided from a PostgreSQL database, which contains important metadata such as the capture method, age, feeding status and gender of the mosquitoes. Additionally, we provide code to extract features and train Bayesian convolutional neural networks for two key tasks: the identification of mosquitoes from their corresponding background environments, and the classification of detected mosquitoes into species. Our extensive dataset is both challenging to machine learning researchers focusing on acoustic identification, and critical to entomologists, geo-spatial modellers and other domain experts to understand mosquito behaviour, model their distribution, and manage the threat they pose to humans.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Globecom</abbr> </div> <div id="parthipan2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A survey of technologies for building trusted networks</div> <div class="author"> Loganathan Parthipan, Liqun Chen, David Gérault, <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, Fei Liu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In sixth-generation (6G) networks trust will also be an important requirement, but how do we build trust in a network? Many researchers have started to pay attention to this, but research in this field is still at an early stage. Taking our lead from the development of trusted computing for single devices we require a root of trust and a mechanism for reliably measuring and reporting on the state of the network. In this paper, we survey existing technologies that we feel can be used to achieve this. We explore trusted computing technologies that enable a single device to be trusted and suggest how they can be adapted to help build a trusted network. For reporting, we need a mechanism to immutably store measurements on the system. We consider that distributed ledger technologies could fulfil this role as they offer immutability, decentralised consensus, and transparency.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">FUSION</abbr> </div> <div id="chen2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Differentiable particle filters through conditional normalizing flow</div> <div class="author"> Xiongjie Chen, Hao Wen, and <em>Yunpeng Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9626998" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00488" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Differentiable particle filters provide a flexible mechanism to adaptively train dynamic and measurement models by learning from observed data.

Solutions to these types of problems often rely on handcrafted features extracted in the time or frequency domain. Recent high-profile advances in deep learning have improved performance across many application domains; however, they typically rely on large data sets that may not always be available. This paper presents an application of deep learning for acoustic event detection in a challenging, data-scarce, real-world problem. We show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), operating on wavelet transformations of audio recordings, demonstrate superior performance over conventional classifiers that utilize handcrafted features. Our key result is that wavelet transformations offer a clear benefit over the more commonly used short-time Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that features, handcrafted for a particular dataset, do not generalize well to other datasets. Conversely, CNNs trained on generic features are able to achieve comparable results across multiple datasets, along with outperforming human labellers. We present our results on the application of both detecting the presence of mosquitoes and the classification of bird species.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">TSP</abbr> </div> <div id="Li2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Invertible particle-flow-based sequential MCMC with extension to Gaussian mixture noise models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, Soumyasundar Pal, and Mark J.

One of the most effective non-linear filtering approaches, particle filtering, suffers from weight degeneracy in high-dimensional filtering scenarios. Several avenues have been pursued to address high dimensionality. Among these, particle flow filters construct effective proposal distributions by using invertible flow to migrate particles continuously from the prior distribution to the posterior, and sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods use a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) accept-reject approach to improve filtering performance. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of invertible particle flow and SMCMC by constructing a composite MH kernel within the SMCMC framework using invertible particle flow. In addition, we propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based particle flow algorithm to construct effective MH kernels for multi-modal distributions. Simulation results show that for high-dimensional state estimation example problems, the proposed kernels significantly increase the acceptance rate with minimal additional computational overhead and improve estimation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art filtering algorithms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ML4D</abbr> </div> <div id="Isupova2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">BCCNet: Bayesian classifier combination neural network</div> <div class="author"> Olga Isupova, <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, Danil Kuzin, Stephen J Roberts, Katherine Willis, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Mosquito acoustic detection aims to provide a cost-effective automated detection tool, based on mosquitoes’ characteristic flight tones. We propose a simple, yet highly effective, classification pipeline based on the mel-frequency spectrum allied with convolutional neural networks. This detection pipeline is computationally efficient in not only detecting mosquitoes, but also in classifying species. Many previous assessments of mosquito acoustic detection techniques have relied only upon lab recordings of mosquito colonies.

In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithms we model scans of breasts with malignant lesions by artificially adding simulated tumour responses to existing scans of healthy volunteers. Tumour responses are constructed based on measured properties of breast tissues and real breast measurements, thus the simulation model takes into account the heterogeneity of the breast tissue. The algorithms we present take advantage of breast scans from other patients or tissue-mimicking breast phantoms to learn about breast content and what constitutes a “tumour-free” and “tumour-bearing” set of measurements.

Recent advances in particle flow filters provide a promising avenue to avoid weight degeneracy; particles drawn from the prior distribution are migrated in the state space to the posterior distribution by solving partial differential equations. Numerous particle flow filters have been proposed based on different assumptions concerning the flow dynamics. Approximations are needed in the implementation of all of these filters; as a result, the particles do not exactly match a sample drawn from the desired posterior distribution. Past efforts to correct the discrepancies involve expensive calculations of importance weights. In this paper, we present new filters which incorporate deterministic particle flows into an encompassing particle filter framework. The valuable theoretical guarantees concerning particle filter performance still apply, but we can exploit the attractive performance of the particle flow methods. The filters we describe involve a computationally efficient weight update step, arising because the embedded particle flows we design possess an invertible mapping property. We evaluate the proposed particle flow particle filters’ performance through numerical simulations of a challenging multitarget multisensor tracking scenario and complex high-dimensional filtering examples.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ML4Audio</abbr> </div> <div id="Li2017c" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cost-sensitive detection with variational autoencoders for environmental acoustic sensing</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, Ivan Kiskin, Davide Zilli, Marianne Sinka, Henry Chan, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Not only is the prevention of mosquito bites of paramount importance to the reduction of malaria transmission cases, but understanding in more forensic detail the interplay between malaria, mosquito vectors, vegetation, standing water and human populations is crucial to the deployment of more effective interventions. Typically the presence and detection of mosquitoes is quantified through insect traps and human operations. If we are to gather timely, large-scale data to improve this situation, we need to automate the process of mosquito detection and classification as much as possible. In this paper, we present a prototype mobile sensing system that acts as both a portable early warning device and an automatic acoustic data acquisition pipeline to help fuel scientific inquiry and policy. The machine learning algorithm that powers the mobile system achieves excellent off-line multi-species detection performance while remaining computationally efficient. Further, we have conducted preliminary live mosquito detection tests using low-cost mobile phones and achieved promising results. The deployment of this system for field usage in Southeast Asia and Africa is planned in the near future. In order to accelerate processing of field recordings and labelling of collected data, we employ a citizen science platform in conjunction with automated methods, the former implemented using the Zooniverse platform, allowing crowdsourcing on a grand scale.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">SPIE</abbr> </div> <div id="saucan2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Particle flow superpositional GLMB filter</div> <div class="author"> Augustin-Alexandru Saucan, <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, and Mark Coates </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In SPIE Conference on Signal Processing, Sensor/Information Fusion, and Target Recognition</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10200/102000F/Particle-flow-superpositional-GLMB-filter/10.1117/12.2263236.short" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="http://networks.ece.mcgill.ca/sites/default/files/particle-flow-superpositional_final.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this paper we propose a Superpositional Marginalized δ-GLMB (SMδ-GLMB) filter for multi-target tracking and we provide bootstrap and particle flow particle filter implementations. Particle filter implementations of the marginalized δ-GLMB filter are computationally demanding. As a first contribution we show that for the specific case of superpositional observation models, a reduced complexity update step can be achieved by employing a superpositional change of variables. The resulting SMδ-GLMB filter can be readily implemented using the unscented Kalman filter or particle filtering methods. As a second contribution, we employ particle flow to produce a measurement-driven importance distribution that serves as a proposal in the SMδ-GLMB particle filter. In high-dimensional state systems or for highly- informative observations the generic particle filter often suffers from weight degeneracy or otherwise requires a prohibitively large number of particles. Particle flow avoids particle weight degeneracy by guiding particles to regions where the posterior is significant. Numerical simulations showcase the reduced complexity and improved performance of the bootstrap SMδ-GLMB filter with respect to the bootstrap Mδ-GLMB filter. The particle flow SMδ-GLMB filter further improves the accuracy of track estimates for highly informative measurements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICASSP</abbr> </div> <div id="saucan2017b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Particle flow SMC delta-GLMB filter</div> <div class="author"> Augustin-Alexandru Saucan, <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, and Mark Coates </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7952984" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="http://networks.ece.mcgill.ca/sites/default/files/pfpf_GLMB_final.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this paper we derive a particle flow particle filter implementation of the δ-Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (δ-GLMB) filter. The bootstrap particle filter δ-GLMB suffers from weight degeneracy for high-dimensional state systems or low measurement noise. In order to avoid weight degeneracy, we employ particle flow to produce a measurement-driven importance distribution that serves as a proposal in the δ-GLMB particle filter. Flow-induced proposals are developed for both types of targets encountered in the δ-GLMB filter, i.e., persistent and birth targets. Numerical simulations reflect the improved performance of the proposed filter with respect to classical bootstrap implementations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICASSP</abbr> </div> <div id="li2017e" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Sequential MCMC with invertible particle flow</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yunpeng Li</em>, and Mark Coates </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7952876" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="http://132.206.31.57/sites/default/files/SMCMC_invertible_particle_flow.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Particle filters are among the most effective filtering algorithms for nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. When the state dimension is high, they are known to suffer from weight degeneracy. Sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods have been proposed as an alternative sequential inference technique that can perform better in high dimensional state spaces. In this paper, we propose to construct a composite Metropolis-Hastings (MH) kernel within the SMCMC framework using invertible particle flow. Simulation results show that the proposed kernel significantly increases the acceptance rate and improves estimation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art filtering algorithms, in high dimensional simulation examples.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Yunpeng Li.
