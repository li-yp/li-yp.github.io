Yunpeng Li is a Reader in AI & Digital Oral Health at the [Centre for Oral, Clinical & Translational Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/research/centre-for-oral-clinical-translational-sciences) in the [Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry) at King’s College London. He was a Junior Research Fellow at [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/) and Postdoctoral Researcher with [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) in the [Machine Learning Research Group](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/about/machine-learning-research-group/) at the University of Oxford from 2017 to 2018. From 2018 to 2024, he was a faculty member in the [Computer Science Research Centre](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/computer-science-research-centre) at the University of Surrey. He completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with [Mark Coates](https://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/) in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) at McGill University in Montréal, Canada in 2017.

His research applies statistical machine learning and Bayesian statistics to a wide range of domains including clinical and environmental AI applications. He is particularly interested in developing novel machine learning methodologies and products to solve unmet needs in dental and oral health, biodiversity, and computational statistics. Ongoing projects include the [Development and pre-market evaluation of AI-assisted dental disease detection with radiography](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/dentists-could-soon-have-a-new-ai-co-pilot-to-detect-tooth-decay) supported by an [NIHR Invention for Innovation (i4i) Product Development Award](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR204566), and [HumBug II: enabling large-scale acoustic monitoring for invasive insect species](https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/the-project#tab-5003961) supported by the [NERC Innovation in Environmental Monitoring programme](https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-invests-in-monitoring-of-natural-environment/).
